# WCTK Redux SSR Demo

An example of:
- Static html response as initial UI state
- Server side rendered web components
- Subscribing web components to state managers
- UI as a function of state

This example is made to work as a github demo.

Obviously a full featured app would be slightly more complicated.

But the list above very broad actions that can be flushed out. 

Maybe interactive elements would be opaque and disabled via css before custom elements are defined?

Maybe!
