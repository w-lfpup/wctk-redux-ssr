# Wctk-Redux-SSR-Demo

A demonstration of how to build a modern (2025) server-side-rendered web app using web components and state management.

Checkout the [live demo](https://w-lfpup.github.io/wctk-redux-ssr-demo)!

## Details

For this example, web components are built using [wctk-js]() and state management is implemented with [redux]()

This example demonstrates how to deliver an SSR response with:
- All styles and initial structure
- No FOUC (flash of unstyled content)
- Web components via declarative shadow dom

Then the initial response:
- Progressively-enhance state-management with redux
- Progressively-enhance interactivity with wctk-js
- Subscribe components to datastores like redux with wctk-js
